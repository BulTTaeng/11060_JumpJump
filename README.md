## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![image](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/11060_JumpJump/blob/main/11060_pro.PNG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

BFS and dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Similar to the problem that I solve (맹세)

Make visit array and save if it is possible to reach that location.

Make all ans =0.

If we did not visit that location before, make visit[loc] = true and push that location to the queue.

Update the ans = before location's ans + 1

If poped element's location is n, ans of poped element is the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
